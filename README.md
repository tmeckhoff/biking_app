<h1>Biking Commuting App: Rate My Ride</h1>
<h2>Prime Digital Academy student personal project: An app to rate areas on a map based on bike friendliness.</h2>
<p>This is a single-page web application developed using the full MEAN stack. A user can select an area on a Google Maps and add a bike friendliness rating of 1-4, and include a title of the rating, their name, and an optional additional comment. Other users can then view these ratings when planning out a bike commute route. The app can viewed at https://radiant-thicket-9470.herokuapp.com/#/home</p>
