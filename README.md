<h1>Biking Commuting App: Rate My Ride</h1>
<h2>Prime Digital Academy student personal project: An app to rate areas on a map based on bike friendliness.</h2>
<p>This is a single-page web application developed using the full MEAN stack. I wanted to make this application because I am a regular bike commuter who uses Google Maps to look up bike routes. The problem with Google Maps is it gives you the quickest route somewhere but not necessarily the most bike friendly option. In my application a user can select an area on a Google Maps and add a bike friendliness rating of 1-4, and include a title of the rating, their name, and an optional additional comment. Other users can then view these ratings when planning out a bike commute route.</p>
<p>Future plans for the application are to create user log in functionality. Once this is added, add the ability to allow users to edit and delete their own ratings but not anyone else's. Additionally, have a user's ratings show up as a different color than other ratings on the map.</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>This application was built using Node.js. To run the application, download the repository and type "npm install" in terminal to download the external dependencies, which have been saved in the package.json file. To open the application, simply type "npm start" and go to http://localhost:5000/.</p>
